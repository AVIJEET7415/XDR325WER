# XDR325WER
Artificial intelligence in operating systems 
- **MAC**  (Media Access Control) - physical or burned-in address - assigned to NIC for communications at the Data Link layer
    - 48 bits long
    - Displayed as 12 hex characters separated by colons
    - First half of address is the **organizationally unique identifier** - identifies manufacurer
    - Second half ensures no two cards on a subnet will have the same address
 - NICs normally only process signals meant for it
 - **Promiscuous mode** - NIC must be in this setting to look at all frames passing on the wire
 - **CSMA/CD** - Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Detection - used over Ethernet to decide who can talk

### <u>ARP</u>

- Stands for Address Resolution Protocol
- Resolves IP address to a MAC address
- Packets are ARP_REQUEST and ARP_REPLY
- Each computer maintains it's own ARP cache, which can be poisoned
- **Commands**
  - arp -a - displays current ARP cache
  - arp -d * - clears ARP cache
- Works on a broadcast basis - both requests and replies are broadcast to everyone
- **Gratuitous ARP** - special packet to update ARP cache even without a request
  - This is used to poison cache on other machines

### <u>IPv6</u>

- Uses 128-bit address
- Has eight groups of four hexadecimal digits
- Sections with all 0s can be shorted to nothing (just has start and end colons)
- Double colon can only be used once
- Loopback address is ::1

| IPv6 Address Type | Description                                           |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Unicast           | Addressed and intended for one host interface         |
| Multicast         | Addressed for multiple host interfaces                |
| Anycast           | Large number of hosts can receive; nearest host opens |

### <u>Windows System Basics</u>

- Everything runs within context of an account
- **Security Context** - user identity and authentication information
- **Security Identifier** (SID) - identifies a user, group or computer account
- **Resource Identifier** (RID) - portion of the SID identifying a specific user, group or computer
- The end  of the SID indicates the user number
  - Example SID:  S-1-5-21-3874928736-367528774-1298337465-**500**
  - **Administrator Account** - SID of 500
  - **Regular Accounts** - start with a SID of 1000
  - **Linux Systems** used user IDs (UID) and group IDs (GID).  Found in /etc/passwd
- **SAM Database** - file where all local passwords are stored (encrypted)
  - Stored in C:\Windows\System32\Config
- **Linux Enumeration Commands**

  - **finger** - info on user and host machine
  - **rpcinfo and rpcclient** - info on RPC in the environment
  - **showmount** - displays all shared directories on the machine

### <u>Banner Grabbing</u>

- **Active** - sending specially crafted packets and comparing responses to determine OS
- **Passive** - reading error messages, sniffing traffic or looking at page extensions
- Easy way to banner grab is connect via telnet on port 
- **Netcat** can also be used to banner grab
  - nc <IPaddress-162.09.09.09.6 or FQDN> <port number>
- Can be used to get information about OS or specific server info 

### <u>NetBIOS Enumeration</u>

- NetBIOS provides name servicing, connectionless communication and some Session layer stuff
- The browser service in Windows designed to host information about all machines within domain or TCP/IP network segment
- NetBIOS name is a **16-character ASCII string** used to identify deviceshttps://neet.nta.nic.in
